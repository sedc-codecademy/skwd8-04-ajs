# Hosting on GitHub Pages 🍉
## What is GitHub Pages? 🍏
GitHub as a service also gives the option for any repository that holds a static site to be hosted on it's platform. This means that if you create a static website and host it on github in a repository, you can get a link and share it with people that can see it online, live.
