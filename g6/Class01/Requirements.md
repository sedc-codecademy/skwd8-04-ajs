# Welcome to E-Library

## Description:

### Web Application for managing our bookstore online. Our application should be able to save and delete books and list them with all info. We want to see if the book is available or not. And lastly we would like to have some filter or search that would show the wanted books by year or by author(or title).

## For the first part:

* Create a book with a constructor from input elements and show it in a list in HTML
* The books should be saved in an array that would represent your book database and use that array (database) for filling the HTML list
* The book should have properties like unique id (random number with 6 digits) title, author, year, if the book is available and
method to lend/return the book (it should correspond with the availibility property)
* Create at least 3 books

## Second part:

* Be able to lend or return the book from HTML
* All books that are available should be green and all books that are not available should be red
* Create function to delete a book

## Third part:

* Create a function to show all books from authors(or titles) that start with a certain letter
* Create a function to search by year(show all books from year n onwards)

## Bonus:
* Show books from year x to year y
* Search author(or title) by any word
* Make it look pretty :)

**Note**: Control of the functionality should come from the user in the HTML

**Hint**: Use the id to manipulate with certain book
