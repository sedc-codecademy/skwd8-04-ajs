# Number checker

## Part 1

Write a function that will give stats about an integer number.

```javascript
function getNumberStats(number){
    // your code here
}
```

The function should return an object with the stats as properties.
The stats required are:
- How many digits the number has (`numDigits` property)
- Is the number odd or even (`isEven` property)
- Is the number positive (`isPositive` property)

## Part 2

Write user interface for the number checker.  
It should include an entry field for the number as well as a button to trigger the calculation. After the calculation, and appropriate response should be shown on the page.

I.e. if the user enters the number **25**, the response should be

*The number 25 is a 2 digit number, it's odd and it's a positive number.*
